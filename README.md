# wireless_fencing_box
Upgrading a fencing box project into a wireless version

The project is based on an existing project available on github :
https://github.com/wnew/fencing_scoring_box

There are also instructions on how to reproduce the hardware here :
https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Fencing-Scoring-Apparatus/

The goal is to start from what has been done and make a system with 2 wireless modules, communicating the hits to a similar shaped base.
